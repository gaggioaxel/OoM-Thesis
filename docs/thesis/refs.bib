  abstract = {We present a computational model and a system for the automated recognition of emotions starting from full-body movement. Three-dimensional motion data of full-body movements are obtained either from professional optical motion-capture systems (Qualisys) or from low-cost RGB-D sensors (Kinect and Kinect2). A number of features are then automatically extracted at different levels, from kinematics of a single joint to more global expressive features inspired by psychology and humanistic theories (e.g., contraction index, fluidity, and impulsiveness). An abstraction layer based on dictionary learning further processes these movement features to increase the model generality and to deal with intraclass variability, noise, and incomplete information characterizing emotion expression in human movement. The resulting feature vector is the input for a classifier performing real-time automatic emotion recognition based on linear support vector machines. The recognition performance of the proposed model is presented and discussed, including the tradeoff between precision of the tracking measures (we compare the Kinect RGB-D sensor and the Qualisys motion-capture system) versus dimension of the training dataset. The resulting model and system have been successfully applied in the development of serious games for helping autistic children learn to recognize and express emotions by means of their full-body movement.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of videogames and motion capture systems in rehabilitation contributes to the recovery of the patient. This systematic review aimed to explore the works related to these technologies. The PRISMA method (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) was used to search the databases Scopus, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science, taking into consideration four aspects: physical rehabilitation, the use of videogames, motion capture technologies, and upper limb rehabilitation. The literature selection was limited to open access works published between 2015 and 2020, obtaining 19 articles that met the inclusion criteria. The works reported the use of inertial measurement units (37%), a Kinect sensor (48%), and other technologies (15%). It was identified that 26% used commercial products, while 74% were developed independently. Another finding was that 47% of the works focus on post-stroke motor recovery. Finally, diverse studies sought to support physical rehabilitation using motion capture systems incorporating inertial units, which offer precision and accessibility at a low cost. There is a clear need to continue generating proposals that confront the challenges of rehabilitation with technologies which offer precision and healthcare coverage, and which, additionally, integrate elements that foster the patient&rsquo;s motivation and participation.},
