\chapter{Auxiliary Graph}

A weighted auxiliary graph is defined for each frame, denoted as $G^{aux}$ := ($V$, $E^{aux}$, $w^{aux}$). \\
The vertices of this auxiliary graph are the same as in the original
graph $G$, but the edge set is comprised of a subset of edges that only connect vertices belonging to different clusters. 
At least one of these edges in the auxiliary graph will be the edge associated with the origin of motion. \\
Later on, we will see how to choose the correct edge.
\\

Considering, for example, a graph $G$ with 3 clusters (see Figure \ref{fig:graph_g}), we can visualize which edges will be involved in the auxiliary graph (Figure \ref{fig:aux_graph}).
