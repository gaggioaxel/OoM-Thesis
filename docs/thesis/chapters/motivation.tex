\section{Motivation}

Movement is one of the first complex actions that we learn when we are born. It defines how we interact with the world around us. 
When moving our bodies,objective we are not simply performing an action aiming to achieve a direct and explicit result, but most of the time we are also communicating with others.
Furthermore, we strive to constantly improve human performances, prevent injuries, promote physical activity and health and inform rehabilitation strategies.
For this reason, the research in human movement has branches in various fields of study such as psychology, biomechanics, physiology and sociology.
