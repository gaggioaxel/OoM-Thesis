\section{Method}

The initial approach to classification involves a straightforward binary classification of the origin of the movement within a specific edge.
If the results had been satisfactory, we would then have opted to evaluate progressively more complex models, eventually leading to the actual classification of the movement's origin from a video segment.

\subsection{Machine Learning Model}
We started by addressing the issue of imbalanced data in classification. Imbalanced data occurs when one class significantly outnumbers the other(s), leading to challenges in training a classifier that can effectively distinguish between the classes.
To mitigate this imbalance, a resampling technique known as BorderlineSMOTE is employed.
